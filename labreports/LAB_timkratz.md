# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  


- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
   

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
   

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
